              The Problem
            </h2>
            <p className="prose text-sm leading-7">
              The substandard Nigerian education system continues to contribute
              to Nigeriaâ€™s weakened institutions and poor leadership capacity
              which are two of the most salient obstacles to progress. We
              recognize that the Nigerian education system is in dire need of
              reform. From promoting cramming over critical thinking and
              engagement, to the lack of passion and desire for
              education-related innovation within and outside the classroom,
              Nigerian students often graduate secondary school under-equipped
              with the skills that they will need to be engaged, critical
              thinkers and leaders.

              Our Solution
            </h2>
            <p className="prose text-sm leading-7">
              BUILD Nigeria seeks to remove Nigerian students from the broken
              educational system and provide them with opportunities to access
              world-class institutions. We also seek to position ourselves as
              leaders in creating meaningful conversations that seek to
              encourage the radical rethinking and reimaging of the Nigerian
              education landscape, allowing members of the public to break free
              from what continues to persist as the status quo of the Nigerian
              education landscape.

              The Outcome
            </h2>
            <p className="prose text-sm leading-7">
              BUILD Nigeria seeks to directly invest in Nigerian youth, and
              inspire, support and cultivate the future leaders of Nigeria so
              that they may be equipped with skills needed to be engaged
              critical thinkers and future leaders of Nigeria. It is our hope
              that one day BUILD Nigeria will no longer need to exist because
              Nigeria itself will be home to world-class educational
              institutions available to every single Nigerian student and
              capable of creating the leaders that we know we deserve.
